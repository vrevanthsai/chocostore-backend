// warning after download of both packages
1Q.(completed)  at start of project(in cmd) 
WARNING in ./node_modules/yup-password/dist/index.js
[1] Module Warning (from ./node_modules/source-map-loader/dist/cjs.js):
[1] Failed to parse source map from 'C:\Webdev-Projects\Ecommerce-MERN-Modified\client\node_modules\yup-password\src\index.ts' file: Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open 'C:\Webdev-Projects\Ecommerce-MERN-Modified\client\node_modules\yup-password\src\index.ts'
Solution:-
-use below code in file-path- node_modules/react-scripts/config/webpack.config.js 
- and pasting this after the line performance: false,
ignoreWarnings: [
      // This is a Manual Edit to prevent webpack warning and it will be removed if npm install is given
      // Ignore warnings raised by source-map-loader.
      // some third party packages may ship miss-configured sourcemaps, that interrupts the build
      // See: https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/discussions/11278#discussioncomment-1780169
      /**
       *
       * @param {import('webpack').WebpackError} warning
       * @returns {boolean}
       */
      function ignoreSourcemapsloaderWarnings(warning) {
        return (
          warning.module &&
          warning.module.resource.includes('node_modules') &&
          warning.details &&
          warning.details.includes('source-map-loader')
        );
      },
    ],
-when deployed we dont include node_modules,so this edit will not be there,
but deployed-site(like render or firebse) will use there own node_modules, so warning will be prevented from there side

2Q.(completed) at homepage-console 
Warning: Layout: Support for defaultProps will be removed from function components in a future major release. Use JavaScript default parameters instead.

    at AuthProvider (http://localhost:3000/static/js/bundle.js:1883:3)
Solution:-
-use direct props-default in prop-call destructure instead of Layout.defaultProps={}
const Layout = ({
  children,
  title = "ChocoStore - Shop now",
  description = "chocolate website or mern stack project",
  keywords = "chocolate,chocolates,product,mern,react,node,mongodb",
  author = "Revanth Sai Velicheti",
}) => {}


3Q. at filter products-homepage(antd- checkout and radio buttons) and delete-category(antd- modal) and DropIn in cart-page
Warning: findDOMNode is deprecated and will be removed in the next major release. Instead, add a ref directly to the element you want to reference. Learn more about using refs safely here: https://reactjs.org/link/strict-mode-find-node
    at http://localhost:3000/static/js/bundle.js:73975:32
    at WaveEffect (http://localhost:3000/static/js/bundle.js:24875:5) (not-completed)
Temporary-Solution:-
-This warning occured due to use of Third-party-Packages(antd,DropIn(braintree))
-ref solution is there in /chatgpt-code-5 but it is not working, so remove antd-components logic 
-and add react-bootstrap components and for DropIn(braintree) use razorpay-components and package

4. at cart page with cart-products (not-completed)
BraintreeError {name: 'BraintreeError', code: 'PAYPAL_SANDBOX_ACCOUNT_NOT_LINKED', message: 'A linked PayPal Sandbox account is required to use…ls on linking your PayPal sandbox with Braintree.', type: 'MERCHANT', details: undefined}
Temporary-solution:-
-create new account in braintree and link with PayPal-dev-account , if not works then use razorpay-package

Doubts:-
1Q.(completed) BY using cart-%{auth.user.name} to store user-cart-products in their cart-name(key) only in LS 
- for multiple accounts in single browser which works
- but effects new users/guest who add cart-products before login or register then after login 
- we can't show his initially added cart-products(when it is set as guest) after login , if we show then 
- old users who login their cart-products will be replaced by guest-products which we can't have . so,
- can't show guest cart-products to new registered user after login in his cart??
Temporary solution:-
- remove all the cart-user.name logic and just use only key- cart in LS for storing every account cart-products
- just use original cart logic for storing or use Redux or Cookies or cartModel(DB) to store cart-products instead of LS
-- see cart-user.name logic in AddToCart.txt in notes folder
Solution:-
- both multiple accounts in single browser and guest cart-products to new registered user after login works
- works by using cart-user.name logic in AddToCart.txt
--- works for cart-user.name but showing cart-products from one device to other devices


2Q. Photo update is not working or like not showing after updating successfully in DB , so problem may be in 
- photo logic , photo Direct-API call(in img tag) , AXios-calls , or delay in passing pid to get photo 

3Q. Remove toast-msgs logic from all and use another package or logic to show msgs(notifications) which
- doesnt lag or stuck when its msg duration is not fineshed
